/*
 * ./DATA/CONSTANTS/firebase_constants.js
 *
 * 'firebase_constants' contains all string constants for the application's
 * Firebase SDK configuration, which are sensitive data of the project.
 *
 * This template serves as a standardized format of setting up these constants
 * to be used for any Firebase-related operations.
 *
 * It is strongly advised to ONLY create a copy of this file template, move to
 * another directory, preferably to its class folder, and enter correct
 * value to each constant to keep the application working.
